## Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Project Gemini 

## Motivation: 
NUSMods has become a website well-beloved by NUS students struggling to plan for the infamous ModReg. It provides a one-stop platform that lists all the available modules, details about said modules like the number of MCs, the available class slots, and student feedback, as well as allows students to plan for the semester’s timetable.

However, NUSMods is not without its flaws. NUSMods fails to sync across devices, and often even resets itself even when on the same device. 

## Aim: 
We hope to improve NUS Mods to be more user friendly and beneficial to students by turning it into a mobile app with some extra functionalities. 

## User Stories: 
1. As a student who uses multiple devices, I want to be able to access my timetable conveniently across all devices without having to input my modules every time.
2. As a student who finds it hard to meet up with friends with busy schedules, I want to be able to easily share my timetable with friends instead of resending it every semester.
3. As an administrator who wants to ensure a positive experience for all users of the system, I want to be able to single out any individual abusing the system, warn them and ban them if they continue to cause problems.

## Scope of Project: 
1. An application version of NUSMods that has all the current functionalities already available in the website.
2. A login & registration page that will allow for students to sync their information across devices seamlessly.
3. A sharing feature that allows students to send their timetables to their friends.

### Features to be completed by mid-June

1. Application version of NUSMods
  1. Allow users to view a subset of modules and create timetables
  2. Display the modules and timetable

1. Login & registration page
  1. Allow users to register an account and log in
  2. Display user account name

## Features to be completed by mid-July
1. Sharing feature 
  1. Allow users to send their timetables to other users
  2. Display other users’ timetables

## Tech Stack 
1. ReactNative (Full-stack)
2. Node.js
3. Postgresql (Backend)
