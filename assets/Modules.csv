CS2030 Programming Methodology II,Computer Science,4 units,"This course is a follow up to CS1010. It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.","if undertaking an Undergraduate Degree then (must not have completed 1 of ""CS1020""/""CS1020E""/""CS2020"" at a grade of at least D and must not have completed CS2030S at a grade of at least D)",if undertaking an Undergraduate Degree then (must have completed 1 of CS1010/CS1010E/CS1010J/CS1010S/CS1010X/CS1101S at a grade of at least D),Y,Y,N,N
